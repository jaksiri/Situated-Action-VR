# Learning About the Concept of Situated Action Through Virtual Reality

The design space that will be addressed in this project is designing a learning environment in Virtual Reality to demonstrate the concept of Situated Action. Situated Action focuses on the relationship between people’s actions and the environment that they’re in. In this case, a VR environment can help with simulating multiple immersive environments with little resources in the real world. This can help provide a better demonstration of how action differs in the context that the user is in.
### Why Situated Action?
While we were learning about this concept, I found it a little difficult to imagine how this concept would apply to the real world. Since this was a concept about action and improvisation, I thought it would be helpful to create an experience that allows people to learn directly through their own experience to develop a better understanding of the topic. 

This topic also aligns with my interest in using virtual reality to help with education as well. I wanted to explore some of the use-cases for virtual reality within the educational space and how/if it can help enhance the student’s learning experience.
### Research Question
How might we design an activity that can demonstrate the approach of Situated Action for college students?
### Goal
My goal for the project is to design an experience where the concept of Situated Action is clearly demonstrated to the user to help with their understanding of the concept.
